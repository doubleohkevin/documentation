title: Kanban Perspective
---

import { ProFeature, CenteredImage, CenteredVideo } from '@site/src/components/CommonBlocks';

<ProFeature />

In this perspective the app shows the sub folders of the current folder as columns of a Kanban board. The files in the columns can represent tasks and the user can move them from one column to another with drag and drop.

<CenteredImage

> **Note:** The development of this perspective is not finalized yet, so the documentation is also work in progress.
