This article will guide through the setting up of a self hosted object storage based on MinIO for Synalogy and QNAP based NAS systems. Then we will show you how to setup the TagSpaces PRO Web on a web server and connect it to the MinIO server.

## Setup Minio on QNAP NAS

> Work in progress

The easies way to run it is with the container app, which run Docker in background.

Make sure Minio docker is started automatically after restarting of your NAS system

## Setup Minio on Synology NAS

> Work in progress, should be similar to setting up the QNAP NAS

### Check if Minio is installed correctly

Open a web browser and navigate to the URL where the MinIO is hosted.
