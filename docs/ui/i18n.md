The user interface of TagSpaces application was translated so for in 26 languages by volunteers. For the coordination of the translation process we utilize the great service of [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com). Since TagSpaces is evolving fast, we need support for the translations of the existing languages and of course we are happy to see when new languages are added. If you want to support the translation efforts please create a Transifex account and apply for membership in the [TagSpaces project](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/tagspaces/) there. The following table lists the languages in which the application is already translated.
