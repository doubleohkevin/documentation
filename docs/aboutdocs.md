import { ProFeature } from '@site/src/components/CommonBlocks';

This documentation has currently a **WIP status**. The articles are being updated on a regular base.

## Documentation structure

This documentation is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), for a streamlined and simple user experience. Each **page** will concern a particular topic, giving **detailed and illustrated explanations** and **instructions** about it. Every page is broken down to different level headings.

The navigation sidebar on the left side of this page will represent the **chapters** as expandable topics, with the **sections** listed in each expanded view.

## Illustrations

Much effort had gone into visually illustrating the documentation, so that you can instantly find what you are looking for, or what is being described in words. Most illustrations will feature some sort of annotation. For example if a **visible element** of the User Interface is discussed, a **neon-green rectangle around an element** will mark its location on the illustrating image.

When there are multiple elements discussed in the same paragraph, the illustrations will be further annotated with numbers, like on the image below while the corresponding numbers will be included in the text, after each element was first mentioned. For example the following image illustrates the structure of the navigation sidebar, with **major parts** (**1**) showing as unselectable titles, expandable **page titles** (**2**) will hold major **section titles** (**3**), both of which are clickable. Clicking page titles will open the corresponding page, while clicking section titles will open the page and scroll down to the start of the selected section.

> **Note to contributors:** When you annotate illustrations please use a rounded edge rectangle, with the following properties:

- **20 px radius** for the rounded corners
- **#1ccd9c color**
- **3-6px line width**, depending on image size (larger images can use thicker lines)
  Additionally, please use a **28pt font size** for numbering with a basic **sans font**.

## Text markup

You will notice, that certain words are marked with **bold text**. These either mean names of elements, or significant notes/concepts about usage. _Italicized words_ usually mark menu items, or other selectable elements, although it is not a hard and fast rule.

Bulleted lists will be used to

- Improve **readability**
- Make it **easier to find** what you are looking for.

## Document symbols

There are currently two types of symbols, apart from the usual text formatting and annotations, that you can find on these pages:

- <ProFeature /> - means that the described feature is part of the TagSpaces Pro and Enterprise editions.
- âš’ - means that the section is not ready yet and may contain unclear, or not up-to-date information, or sections might be missing entirely.
