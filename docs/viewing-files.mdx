TagSpaces is designed with extensibility in mind so any other kind of file viewers can be easily developed and integrated.

> **Source code browser and editor** The text editor supports source code highlighting for many common programming languages. This in combination with the build in [JSON editor](/extensions/json-editor) makes the application a good source code navigator with basic editing capabilities. The intention here is not to makes TagSpaces your next IDE, but rather to give your quick overview of source code repositories.
